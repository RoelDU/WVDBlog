Welcome,
This website is mainly to share thoughts, guidance, ideas and learnings I see during my day to day activities as WVD CAT PM at Microsoft. CAT stands fot the Customer Accaleration Team (CAT) which is a team part of the Product Group who partners with strategic enterprise customers to enable successful deployments of Windows Virtual Desktop. In this role we capture feedback and insights to improve the existing product and develop new product capabilities.

Considering the amount of work and timezone I cover (and I have 3 beautifull young kids) I do not have much time to post a lot but I will do my best. Additionally I post on my Linkdin and our Microsoft Tech Community site  <https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-virtual-desktop/bd-p/WindowsVirtualDesktop>.

If you like it please let me know and if you don't, sorry I'm too busy.

Have Fun!
